# Animated Navigation Bar

This project demonstrates an **animated navigation bar** with a responsive design, hover effects, and a hamburger menu for mobile devices. The navigation bar is designed to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience for users, making it suitable for modern websites.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices using Flexbox and media queries.
- **Hamburger Menu**: On mobile screens, a hamburger icon appears, which animates into a close icon when clicked, revealing the navigation links.
- **Hover Effects**: Navigation links feature animated underlines that grow on hover for a modern touch.
- **Sticky Navigation**: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page when scrolling, ensuring easy access to navigation at all times.
- **Search Bar**: An optional search bar that expands when focused and collapses when not in use.
- **Animations**: 
  - The navigation bar slides in from the top on page load.
  - The mobile menu slides in from the left when the hamburger icon is clicked.
  - Smooth transitions for all interactive elements.
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA labels and is keyboard navigable for better accessibility.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML5**: For the structure of the navigation bar.
  - **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and transitions.
  - **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: For interactivity, such as toggling the hamburger menu and handling the search bar.

> **Optional**: You can use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for faster styling, but this project uses plain CSS for simplicity.

## Usage

To use this animated navigation bar in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser to see the navigation bar in action.
3. **Integrate into your project**:
   - Copy the HTML structure from `index.html` into your webpage.
   - Include the CSS from `styles.css` in your stylesheet.
   - Add the JavaScript from `script.js` to your scripts.
4. **Customize** as needed (see the [Customization](#customization) section below).

## Project Structure

```bash
animated-navigation-bar/
├── index.html       # HTML structure of the navigation bar
├── styles.css       # CSS styles and animations
└── script.js        # JavaScript for interactivity
```

## Customization

You can easily customize the navigation bar to fit your website's design and functionality:

- **Change Colors**: Modify the background color of the navigation bar by updating the `.navbar` class in `styles.css`.
- **Add/Remove Links**: Edit the `<ul class="nav-links">` list in `index.html` to add or remove navigation items.
- **Adjust Breakpoints**: Modify the media query in `styles.css` to change the screen size at which the mobile menu appears (default is 768px).
- **Modify Animations**: Adjust the animation properties in `styles.css` to change the speed or style of transitions and animations.
- **Search Bar**: If you don't need the search bar, simply remove the `<div class="search-bar">` section from `index.html`.

## How It Works

- **Desktop View**:
  - The navigation links are displayed horizontally with hover effects.
  - The search bar is visible and expands when focused.
  
- **Mobile View**:
  - The hamburger icon appears, and when clicked, the navigation links slide in from the left as a full-screen overlay.
  - The hamburger icon animates into a close icon when the menu is open.
  - Clicking on a navigation link closes the mobile menu.

- **Sticky Behavior**:
  - The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls.

## Known Limitations

- The search bar functionality is purely visual and does not include actual search logic. You will need to implement search functionality separately if required.
- The project uses Vanilla JavaScript; if your project uses a framework like React or Vue, you may need to adapt the code accordingly.
